As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) 
frequently exhibit errors when solving scientific problems, evaluating the validity of their reasoning processes is critical for ensuring reliability and uncovering fine-grained model weaknesses. Since human evaluation is laborious and costly, prompting MLLMs as automated process judges has become a common practice.
However, the reliability of these model-based judges remains uncertain.

🌈To address this, we introduce <strong>ProJudgeBench</strong>, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of MLLM-based process judges.
ProJudgeBench comprises 2,400 test cases and 50,118 step-level labels, spanning four scientific disciplines with diverse difficulty levels and multi-modal content. 
In ProJudgeBench, each step is meticulously annotated by human experts for correctness, error type, and explanation, enabling a systematic evaluation of judges' capabilities to detect, classify and diagnose errors.
Evaluation on ProJudgeBench reveals a significant performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. 
To bridge this gap, we further propose <strong>ProJudge-173k</strong>, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a <strong>Dynamic Dual-Phase</strong> fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to explicitly reason through problem-solving before assessing solutions. Both contributions significantly enhance the process evaluation capabilities of open-source models.
We release all the resources to foster future research of reliable multi-modal process evaluation.

## 📢 News
- ✨ [03/11/2025] We release our paper and project page.

## 💡 Highlights
- 🔥 **Multi-modal, Multi-discipline, and Multi-difficulty**: Our benchmark comprises 2,400 test cases and 50,118 step-level labels, spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, with diverse difficulty levels and multi-modal content.
- 🔥 **Fine-grained Error Analysis**: We define seven error types that encompass common mistakes models may make in long reasoning chains. Each step is meticulously annotated by human experts for correctness, error type, and explanation, enabling a systematic evaluation of process judges' capabilities to detect, classify, and diagnose errors in scientific problem-solving tasks.
- 🔥 **Realistic and Diverse Error Patterns**: To ensure real-world applicability, we collect solutions from 10 distinct MLLMs of varying sizes, architectures, and design goals, reflecting a broad spectrum of realistic reasoning behaviors and error patterns.

Codes and Dataset will be coming soon!
